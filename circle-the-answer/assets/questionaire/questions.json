          ],
          "answer": "Push",
          "explanation": "The Push operation allows users to insert elements in the stack. If the stack is filled completely and trying to perform push operation, stack-overflow can happen."

          ],
          "answer": "Top",
          "explanation": "There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider the simple example of plates stacked over one another in a canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e., the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period. So, it can be simply seen to follow the LIFO/FILO order."

          "answer": "Underflow",
          "explanation": "Underflow occurs when the user performs a pop operation on an empty stack. Overflow occurs when the stack is full, and the user performs a push operation. Garbage Collection is used to recover the memory occupied by objects that are no longer used"

          ],
          "answer": "Stack",
          "explanation": "The stack is a simple data structure in which elements are added and removed based on the LIFO principle. Open parenthesis is pushed into the stack and a closed parenthesis pops out elements till the top element of the stack is its corresponding open parenthesis. If the stack is empty, parenthesis is balanced otherwise it is unbalanced."

          ],
          "answer": "Stack",
          "explanation": "In serial access memory data records are stored one after the other in which they are created and are accessed sequentially. In stack data structure, elements are accessed sequentially. Stack data structure resembles the serial access memory."

          ],
          "answer": "Stack",
          "explanation": "The Stack data structure is used to convert infix expression to postfix expression. The purpose of stack is to reverse the order of the operators in the expression. It also serves as a storage structure, as no operator can be printed until both of its operands have appeared."

          "answer": "Both Link and Data",
          "explanation": "A linked list is a collection of objects linked together by references from an object to another object. By convention these objects are names as nodes. Linked list consists of nodes where each node contains one or more data fields and a reference(link) to the next node."

          "answer": "Queue",
          "explanation": "Breadth First Traversal is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from root node and explores all the neighbouring nodes. Then, it selects the nearest node and explore all the unexplored nodes. The algorithm follows the same process for each of the nearest node until it finds the goal."
